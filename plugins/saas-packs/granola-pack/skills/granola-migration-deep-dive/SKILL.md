## Overview
Comprehensive guide for migrating to Granola from Otter.ai, Fireflies, Fathom, Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams.

## Prerequisites
- Access to source tool with export capability
- Granola workspace configured
- Migration timeline agreed with stakeholders

## Migration Sources

| Tool | Export Format | Complexity |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Otter.ai | TXT, SRT, PDF | Medium |
| Fireflies.ai | TXT, JSON, PDF | Medium |
| Fathom | Markdown, CSV | Low |
| Zoom/Meet/Teams | VTT, TXT | Low |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Migration Strategy
- **Clean Start** (<100 meetings): Start fresh, archive history externally
- **Selective** (100-1000): Migrate key meetings only (client calls, decisions)
- **Full** (Enterprise): Export everything, transform, import all

### Step 2: Assess and Inventory
Document total meetings, date range, storage size, content types, and integration dependencies.

### Step 3: Export from Source
Follow source-specific export procedures (bulk export for Pro/Enterprise plans).

### Step 4: Convert and Import
Run conversion scripts to transform source formats to Granola-compatible Markdown. Archive in Notion/Drive.

### Step 5: Parallel Run (2 weeks)
Record in Granola as primary while keeping source as backup. Compare quality daily.

### Step 6: Cutover
Final export from source, disable source recording, cancel subscription, monitor closely for 3 days.

See [detailed implementation](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md) for source-specific export procedures, conversion scripts, execution timeline, communication templates, and rollback plan.

## Output
- Source data exported and backed up
- Historical meetings converted and archived
- Granola configured with integrations
- Team migrated and recording in Granola

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing transcripts | Export format limitation | Re-export in different format |
| Failed conversion | Unexpected source format | Update conversion script |
| Low adoption | Insufficient training | Add training sessions, share quick wins |
| Data gaps | Incomplete export | Run secondary export, verify counts |

## Examples
