## Overview
Comprehensive guide for complex migrations to or between Langfuse instances, including cloud-to-self-hosted, LangSmith-to-Langfuse, and zero-downtime dual-write patterns.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of source and target systems
- Database access (for data migrations)
- Downtime window planned (if needed)
- Rollback plan prepared

## Instructions

### Step 1: Export Data from Source
Paginate through all traces, scores, and datasets. Export to JSON files with rate limiting (200ms between pages).

### Step 2: Set Up Target Instance
For self-hosted: deploy via Docker Compose with PostgreSQL. Configure auth, secrets, and encryption.

### Step 3: Import Data to Target
Recreate traces with original metadata plus `migratedFrom` and `originalId` fields. Flush after each file.

### Step 4: Implement Dual-Write (Zero-Downtime)
During migration, write to both old and new systems. Gradually shift: Week 1 dual-write, Week 3 cutover.

### Step 5: Validate Migration
Compare trace counts (allow 1% variance). Spot-check random traces by `originalId`.

### Step 6: Execute Rollback if Needed
Switch environment variables back to old system and restart.

See [detailed implementation](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md) for advanced patterns.

## Output
- Exported trace data from source
- Running target Langfuse instance
- Validated data migration
- Dual-write capability for zero-downtime

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Data loss | Incomplete export | Re-run with pagination |
| Duplicate traces | Re-import | Dedupe by originalId |
| Missing metadata | Format mismatch | Update adapter |
| Performance issues | Large import | Use batch processing |

## Examples

### Migration Scenarios
| Scenario | Complexity | Downtime | Data Loss Risk |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Cloud to Cloud | Low | None | None |
| Self-hosted to Cloud | Medium | Minutes | Low |
| Other platform to Langfuse | High | Hours | Medium |
| SDK version upgrade | Low | None | None |
