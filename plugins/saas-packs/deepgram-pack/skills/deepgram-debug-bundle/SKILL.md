## Overview
Collect comprehensive debug information for Deepgram support tickets and troubleshooting. Bundles environment info, API connectivity tests, request logs, audio analysis, and reproduction scripts into a single archive.

## Prerequisites
- Deepgram API key configured
- Access to application logs
- Sample audio file that reproduces issue

## Instructions

### Step 1: Collect Environment Info
Gather system and SDK version information (Node.js, Python, OS, SDK versions).

### Step 2: Test API Connectivity
Verify REST API and WebSocket endpoint reachability with `curl` against `api.deepgram.com`.

### Step 3: Capture Request/Response
Use `DeepgramDebugger` class to log full request/response details with timing and error capture.

### Step 4: Create Minimal Reproduction
Build a standalone script that reproduces the issue with the NASA podcast sample audio.

### Step 5: Analyze Audio (if applicable)
Run `ffprobe` analysis on the audio file to verify format, encoding, and duration.

### Step 6: Package Debug Bundle
Run `collect-debug-bundle.sh` to compile environment, connectivity, logs, and audio analysis into a `.tar.gz` archive.

## Output
- `deepgram-debug-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz` containing:
  - `environment.txt` - System and SDK versions
  - `connectivity.txt` - API connectivity test results
  - `app-logs.txt` - Recent application logs (sanitized)
  - `audio-analysis.txt` - Audio file details (if provided)
  - `README.txt` - Bundle description and issue template

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| API connectivity fails | Invalid key or network | Verify `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` and network access |
| Empty response | Silent or corrupt audio | Check audio format with `ffprobe` |
| SDK not found | Missing dependency | Run `npm list @deepgram/sdk` or `pip show deepgram-sdk` |

## Examples

### Support Ticket Template
Include: issue summary, environment details, request IDs, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and attach the debug bundle archive.

### Quick Connectivity Test
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X GET 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects' \
  -H "Authorization: Token $DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
```
