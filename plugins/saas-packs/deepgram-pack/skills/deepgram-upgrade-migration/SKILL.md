## Overview
Guide for planning and executing Deepgram SDK upgrades (v2 to v3), model migrations (Nova to Nova-2), and API version transitions with A/B testing, validation, and rollback procedures.

## Prerequisites
- Current SDK version documented
- Test environment available
- Rollback plan prepared
- Changelog reviewed

## Instructions

### Assess current configuration
Document current SDK version (`npm list @deepgram/sdk`), model in use, and configuration. Review GitHub releases for breaking changes.

### Step 2: Apply SDK v3 Breaking Changes
Update imports (`createClient` instead of `new Deepgram`), method calls (`listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl` instead of `transcription.preRecorded`), and response handling (destructured `{ result, error }`).

### Step 3: Migrate Models
Switch from Nova to Nova-2 for improved accuracy (47 languages vs 36). The model parameter is a simple config change; all other options remain the same.

### Step 4: A/B Test Models
Compare models side-by-side on test audio: measure confidence scores, processing times, and transcript quality before committing.

### Step 5: Validate and Deploy
Run automated validation: test API connectivity, pre-recorded transcription, and live transcription connection. Monitor dashboards for 30 minutes post-deploy.

### Step 6: Prepare Rollback
Record deployment versions. Keep rollback instructions ready: revert package version, reinstall, verify tests, redeploy.

See [detailed implementation](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md) for advanced patterns.

## Output
- SDK v3 migration checklist
- Model comparison results
- Automated validation suite
- Rollback procedures and scripts

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Import errors | Old import syntax | Update to `{ createClient }` |
| Method not found | API change | Use `listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl` |
| Response structure | Destructuring change | Use `{ result, error }` pattern |
| Quality regression | Model change | A/B test before committing |

## Examples

### Migration Types
| Type | Description | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| SDK Version | v2.x to v3.x | Medium (breaking changes) |
| Model Migration | Nova to Nova-2 | Low (config change) |
| API Version | v1 to v2 | High (endpoint changes) |

### v3 Quick Reference
```typescript
// Old: import Deepgram from '@deepgram/sdk'
// New:
import { createClient } from '@deepgram/sdk';
const deepgram = createClient(apiKey);
const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
  { url: audioUrl }, { model: 'nova-2', smart_format: true }
);
```
