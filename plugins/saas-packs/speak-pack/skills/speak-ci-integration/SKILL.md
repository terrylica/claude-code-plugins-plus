# Speak CI Integration

## Overview
Integrate Speak language learning API validation into CI/CD pipelines. Covers pronunciation analysis endpoint testing, lesson content validation, API response format verification, and regression testing for language assessment accuracy.

## Prerequisites
- Speak API key stored as GitHub secret
- GitHub Actions configured
- Test framework (Vitest or Jest)
- Audio test fixtures for pronunciation tests

## Instructions

For full implementation details, load: `Read(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation-guide.md)`

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| API key invalid | Secret not set | Add `SPEAK_API_KEY` to repo secrets |
| Audio fixture too large | Uncompressed WAV | Compress to 16-bit mono |
| Lesson validation fails | Missing required field | Check schema and fix JSON files |
| Flaky pronunciation test | Audio quality varies | Use consistent test recordings |

## Examples
### Minimal Smoke Test
```yaml
- name: Speak API health check
  env:
    SPEAK_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SPEAK_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPEAK_API_KEY" \
      https://api.speak.com/v1/languages | jq '.languages | length'
```
