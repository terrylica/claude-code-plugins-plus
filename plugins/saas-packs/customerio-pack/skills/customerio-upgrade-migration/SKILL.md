# Customer.io Upgrade & Migration

## Overview
Plan and execute Customer.io SDK upgrades and migrations safely with staged rollouts, feature flags, and rollback procedures.

## Prerequisites
- Current SDK version identified
- Test environment available
- Rollback plan prepared

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assess Current State
Run version assessment scripts to identify installed SDK versions for Node.js and Python, and check for latest available versions.

### Step 2: Review Breaking Changes
Review the Customer.io changelog for breaking changes between your current and target versions (ESM modules, region config, event data structure changes).

### Step 3: Create Migration Plan
Document current version, target version, breaking changes, required code changes, test cases, rollback procedure, and timeline.

### Step 4: Update Dependencies
Install the target SDK version. Use exact version pinning for production.

### Step 5: Update Code for Breaking Changes
Apply code changes for the new API (e.g., legacy `CustomerIO` to `TrackClient`, positional args to object params).

### Step 6: Write Migration Tests
Create a test suite that validates identify, track, and error handling with the new SDK version.

### Step 7: Implement Staged Rollout
Use feature flags with hash-based percentage rollout to gradually shift traffic from legacy to new SDK.

### Step 8: Run Post-Migration Verification
Verify new SDK is installed, all tests pass, error rates are stable, and delivery metrics are normal.

## Migration Checklist
- [ ] Current version documented
- [ ] Breaking changes reviewed
- [ ] Code changes identified and implemented
- [ ] Migration tests passing
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Staged rollout plan ready
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Team notified

## Error Handling
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Breaking change missed | Revert and add to change list |
| Performance regression | Profile and optimize or rollback |
| Unexpected errors | Check if error types changed |
