# Lindy Migration Deep Dive

## Overview
Advanced migration strategies for moving to or upgrading Lindy AI integrations including platform migration, agent consolidation, and multi-environment rollout.

## Prerequisites
- Source platform documentation
- Target Lindy environment ready
- Migration timeline approved
- Rollback plan defined

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assess Migration Scope
Analyze source system agents and workflows. Classify complexity (simple/moderate/complex) and estimate duration based on agent count and workflow complexity.

### Step 2: Plan Agent Consolidation
Identify duplicate or overlapping agents. Merge instructions, collect unique tools, and create consolidated agents with clear specialization sections.

### Step 3: Create Multi-Environment Migration Plan
Define phases (development, staging, production) with specific steps, duration, and success criteria for each. Include rollback checkpoints at key milestones.

### Step 4: Execute Data Migration
Export from source, transform to Lindy format using source-specific transforms (OpenAI, LangChain, custom), validate, and import.

### Step 5: Set Up Rollback Procedures
Create checkpoint snapshots of agents and automations before each phase. Implement rollback that deletes new agents and restores modified ones.

### Step 6: Run Migration Script
Execute the phased migration: assess, export, transform, validate, checkpoint, import, test.

`Read(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation-guide.md)`

## Migration Checklist
- [ ] Source system documented
- [ ] Migration plan approved
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Data transformation validated
- [ ] Feature parity confirmed
- [ ] Integration tests created
- [ ] Load tests passed
- [ ] Parallel run completed
- [ ] Cutover window scheduled
- [ ] Support team briefed

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Data loss | Transform error | Validate before import |
| Parity gap | Feature difference | Document and workaround |
| Rollback fail | Incomplete checkpoint | Create full snapshots |

## Next Steps
This completes the Flagship tier skills. Consider reviewing Standard and Pro skills for comprehensive coverage.

## Output

- Configuration files or code changes applied to the project
- Validation report confirming correct implementation
- Summary of changes made and their rationale

See [migration implementation details](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md) for output format specifications.

## Examples

**Basic usage**: Apply lindy migration deep dive to a standard project setup with default configuration options.

**Advanced scenario**: Customize lindy migration deep dive for production environments with multiple constraints and team-specific requirements.
