## Overview
Comprehensive guide for migrating presentations and workflows from PowerPoint, Google Slides, Canva, and other platforms to Gamma with validation and rollback support.

## Prerequisites
- Gamma API access
- Source platform export capabilities
- Node.js 18+ for migration scripts
- Sufficient Gamma storage quota

## Instructions

### Step 1: Inventory Source Presentations
Scan source directories for `.pptx`, `.pdf`, and `.key` files. Generate a JSON inventory with metadata (title, size, source platform, last modified).

### Step 2: Build Migration Engine
Create a migration engine with concurrent batch processing, retry logic, and progress reporting. Use `PQueue` for concurrency control.

### Step 3: Handle Platform-Specific Exports
- **Google Slides**: Export via Drive API as `.pptx`, then import to Gamma
- **PowerPoint**: Extract metadata from `docProps/core.xml` before import
- **Canva/Keynote**: Export as `.pptx` first, then import

### Step 4: Validate Migrated Presentations
Verify each migrated presentation has slides, all assets loaded, and can export.

### Step 5: Create Rollback Snapshots
Save source-to-Gamma ID mappings as snapshots. If migration fails, delete Gamma copies.

See [detailed implementation](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md) for advanced patterns.

## Output
- Migration inventory JSON
- Batch migration with concurrency control
- Platform-specific import handlers
- Validation and rollback support

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Import timeout | Large file size | Increase timeout to 120s |
| Asset missing | Embedded fonts/media | Re-export with embedded assets |
| Format mismatch | Unsupported features | Export as PDF fallback |

## Examples

### Supported Migration Paths
| Source | Format | Fidelity | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| PowerPoint | .pptx | High | Native import |
| Google Slides | .pptx export | High | Export first |
| Canva | .pdf/.pptx | Medium | Limited animations |
| Keynote | .pptx export | High | Export first |
| Markdown | .md | High | Structure preserved |

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Inventory all source presentations
- [ ] Test import with sample files
- [ ] Run migration in batches
- [ ] Validate each batch
- [ ] Update links and references
